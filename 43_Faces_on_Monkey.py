# It is common for images of a countryâ€™s previous leaders, or other individuals of his-
# torical significance, to appear on its money. The individuals that appear on banknotes
# in the United States are listed in Table 2.1.

# Individual            | Amount

# George Washington     | $1
# Thomas Jefferson      | $2
# Abraham Lincoln       | $5
# Alexander Hamilton    | $10
# Andrew Jackson        | $20
# Ulysses S. Grant      | $50
# Benjamin Franklin     | $100

# Write a program that begins by reading the denomination of a banknote from the
# user. Then your program should display the name of the individual that appears on the
# banknote of the entered amount. An appropriate error message should be displayed
# if no such note exists.
