# 53
# At a particular company, employees are rated at the end of each year. The rating scale
# begins at 0.0, with higher values indicating better performance and resulting in larger
# raises. The value awarded to an employee is either 0.0, 0.4, or 0.6 or more. Values
# between 0.0 and 0.4, and between 0.4 and 0.6 are never used. The meaning associated
# with each rating is shown in the following table. The amount of an employee’s raise
# is $2400.00 multiplied by their rating.

# Rating| Meaning

# 0.0   | Unacceptable performance
# 0.4   | Acceptable performance
# 0.6   | or more Meritorious performance

# Write a program that reads a rating from the user and indicates whether the perfor-
# mance was unacceptable, acceptable or meritorious. The amount of the employee’s
# raise should also be reported. Your program should display an appropriate error
# message if an invalid rating is entered.
